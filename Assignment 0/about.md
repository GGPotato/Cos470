Your experience programming, with c#, with Git.

I know Java and kind of newish, nothing in C#, new to git but learning fast.

Topics that interest you

I like AI's, big data, but my focus is to get actual job skills.

Career goals

To get one, but also to be the best (as much as I can be) in that field. I just really want to start working so I know what people do after college with a CS degree. I have seen a lot of what we need to learn but I donâ€™t know what employers want that from us. 

What you want to get out of this class

I want to get the idea of what a software dev does on the day to day first hand.

Learning style

According to http://www.educationplanner.org I am a Visual/Tactile learner.  

Anything else you'd like me to know
