First make sure you have both your Solutions explore and your team explore open
then hit the home button on both
then edit the file/folder you want 
then in the solution Explorer click the sync button (looks like two arrows pointed in oppsite directions)
then in the team explore click the changes button (looks like a clock)
then add a comment in the message box
then push the "Commit All and Push" button (located in the Commit all dropdown)
