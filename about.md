Your experience programming, with c#, with Git.
I know Java and kind of newish, nothing in C#, new to git but learning fast.

Topics that interest you
I like AI's, big data/wide data, but my focus is to get actual job skills.

Career goals
to get one, but also to be the best (as much as I can be) in that field. I just really want to start working so I know what people do after college with a CS degree. I have seen a lot of what we need to learn but I don’t know what employers want that from us. 

What you want to get out of this class
I want to get the idea of what a software dev does on the day to day first hand.

Learning style
don’t know

Anything else you'd like me to know

I am edditing this in on 9/12/19
